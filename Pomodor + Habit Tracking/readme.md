FocusFlow: Pomodoro & Habit Tracker:

Designed and implemented a Pomodoro and habit tracker program in Python, utilizing a GUI Pomodoro countdown timer for 30-minute work intervals.
Integrated the program with the Pixela API for habit tracking, allowing users to log their study or work sessions as pixels on a graph.
Implemented functionality to send daily email updates to users, summarizing their previous day's work for target tracking and motivation.
Utilized Python's tkinter library for the GUI, requests library for API interactions, and smtplib for email functionality.
